## Prediction models for antimalarial activity of drugs using Perturbation Theory and Machine Learning
The main objective of this project is to search for a prediction model for new antimalarial compounds using QSAR-type models based on Machine Learning techniques, with features transformed as inputs in such a way that we introduce the perturbations of the molecular descriptors in different experimental conditions.

The best results were obtained by Random Forest classifier model with an AUROC value of 0.8738 and an accuracy value of 0.8425 demonstrating a high capacity to predict antimalarial activity compounds. Also, feature importances values were calculated to know which are the most relevant for our model.
