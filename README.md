## Prediction models for antimalarial activity of drugs using Perturbation Theory and Machine Learning

Malaria, the most virulent parasitic disease, continues to be one of the greatest health problems in the world. Efforts to discover new drugs with antimalarial activity have generated large datasets of multiple preclinical assays with different experimental conditions that are accessible through databases such as ChEMBL which contains more than 30,000 different antimalarial assays. Using these data, we combine Perturbation Theory with Machine Learning (PTML) to build models with the ability to predict the probability that a compound has antimalarial activity against the malaria-causing Plasmodium. This can save time and experimental resources. 
9 Machine Learning classifiers have been used with 6 dependent characteristics of 4 different experimental conditions. Using data engineering, 24 new entries have been created as expected value and their respective perturbations as descriptors under experimental conditions. 
The best results were obtained by Random Forest classifier model with an AUROC value of 0.8738 and an accuracy value of 0.8425 demonstrating a high capacity to predict antimalarial activity compounds. Also, feature importances values were calculated to know which are the most relevant for our model.
